## Server Sent Events (SSE)
  
Traditionally, a web page has to send a request to the server to receive new data; that is, the page requests data from the server. With server-sent events, it's possible for a server to send new data to a web page at any time, by pushing messages to the web page. These incoming messages can be treated as _[Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event)  + data_ inside the web page.
